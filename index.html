        <h3>Call of Duty</h3>
        <p>
            Call of duty is a competitive first person shooter. I mostly play CDL which stands for Call of Duty League. This is a game mode where you test your skills against other players and you get a global rank. Then you go against other players that are similar skill level to you and compete to climb the ranks. 
        </p>
        <h3>Rocket League</h3>
        <p>
            Rocket League is my most played game and I am pretty good at it. This game is highly dependent on highly advanced mechanics. You have to try to hit the ball in to they net with a car. These cars are rocket powered and you have to use boost to get to the ball faster and hit it while flying in the air. 
        </p>
        <h3>Fortnite</h3>
        <p>Fortnite is a third person shooter with building mechanics. This game is very competitive and there are in game tournaments where you can win money. Building and editing are the base of this game and it is easy to be good but very hard to master the game. </p>
        <h3>Call of the Wild: The Angler</h3>
        <p>
            Call of the wild: The Angler is one of my favotite games right now. THis is an open world roaming game where you can fish wherever you want. You have to level up so that you can get better lines, lures, rods, reals, and baits.
